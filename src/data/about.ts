      "My journey into web development began in a very different field: Electrical Engineering. Initially, I started my career at Infosys BPM Ltd in the Order Management Process team, where I developed skills in task coordination and inter-team collaboration. However, I soon realized that this role didn’t align with my aspirations. I was drawn to more dynamic and creative fields within the IT industry, and that curiosity led me to explore opportunities in web hosting and support.",
      "This exploration brought me to Diya Systems, where I worked as an agent specializing in web hosting technologies. In this role, I provided support for customers dealing with server-related website issues. It was my first hands-on experience in the tech world, and I became deeply interested in the inner workings of websites, server management, and troubleshooting. This exposure sparked my passion for web development, leading me to start learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in my free time. It didn’t take long before I realized that web development was where I wanted to focus my career.",
      "Driven to build a professional path in web development, I transitioned to a role as a full-time Frontend Developer at Codebele. This role allowed me to immerse myself fully in creating interactive and responsive websites. I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap, transforming static designs into dynamic and user-friendly web pages. Codebele was an incredible place to learn, and later, when it was acquired by Terralogic, I continued as a full-time employee there, further developing my frontend skills and working on projects that deliver high-quality, responsive web solutions for clients.",
      "Over the last 2.8 years at Terralogic, I’ve had the opportunity to work on various projects, building websites that are both functional and engaging. My work has involved every stage of the development process, from planning and design to coding and testing. I’ve used my skills to design custom email templates that support effective client communication and created interactive web pages that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.",
      "I have expanded my skill set by learning React and Next.js, gaining a solid grasp of these technologies and applying them in several projects. This experience has deepened my understanding of frontend development and broadened my web development capabilities, allowing me to build modern, responsive, and high-performance web applications.",
      "After gaining strong experience at Terralogic, I joined Zyptr as the next step in my career growth. Being highly curious about web technologies, I believe startup environments offer broader exposure and faster hands-on learning compared to larger organizations. At Zyptr, I currently work as a Frontend Developer, collaborating closely with a team of 15+ members in a fast-paced startup environment. While not officially titled as a team lead, I actively contribute to technical decisions, UI architecture, and design quality. I help guide teammates, review implementations, and support the development of modern React and Next.js applications with a strong focus on performance, scalability, clean code practices, and impactful user experiences.",
      "As a developer, I am always looking to learn and grow. The tech industry is constantly evolving, and staying up-to-date with the latest tools and technologies is essential to remain competitive. I regularly take online courses, attend workshops, and read articles to keep my skills sharp and broaden my knowledge. I also enjoy collaborating with other developers, as I believe that sharing knowledge and ideas is key to improving as a professional.",
      "Outside of work, I am passionate about building personal projects that allow me to experiment with new ideas and learn new skills. I also enjoy contributing to open-source projects, as it allows me to collaborate with developers from all over the world and give back to the community that has helped me grow. These projects not only enhance my technical abilities but also provide me with the opportunity to work on projects that I am truly passionate about.",
      "In conclusion, my journey from an electrical engineer to a web developer has been a rewarding one, filled with challenges and opportunities to learn. My passion for technology and problem-solving continues to drive me as I work on building interactive and engaging web experiences. I am excited about the future of web development and look forward to continuing to grow as a developer, taking on new challenges, and contributing to the digital world in meaningful ways.",
